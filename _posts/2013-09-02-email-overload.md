> **A huge wave of emails is approaching.**

Due to subscribe to linux.debian.user mailing list I have to receive a lot of emails every day. Usually if they are normal emails from my friends and/or people I contact, I always reply to them out of the respect.

However, they are just overwhelming my inbox, hence the mailing list is no longer being subscribed by me, bid farewell.

Unlike Weibo, Twitter and some other IM softwares. My email philosophy is to contact and communicate to people I meet from MOOC, blogs and other places. Emails are always replied in time, in order to achieve the goal - I try my best to keep them neat, simple and plain. Even so sometimes I have to write a long but necessary reply to questions demonstrate my opinions.

Every morning when I woke up checking my Gmail through Thunderbird, at least 30 email were waiting for me to check and reply - though most of them were NOT necessary or contained useful information to me, hence I abandoned them. I hope when I check my emails in the future every morning, no more unnecessary emails and spams were them - instead something useful.

The reason the blog being here is not for complaining but practicing writing skills and marking the "event", even I don't know it counts or not.

At the end of the blog, I'd like to say I wrote a more-than-400-word email yesterday night - TOEFL asks to write more than 300 words.

I rocked.
