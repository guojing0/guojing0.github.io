However, to stick to the old familiar, simple name that your grandfather called it. It has stood the test of time, and old friends are alway good friends.

坚持用你爷爷都能认出来的旧而熟悉、简单的名字。它经受住了时间的考验，老朋友总是好朋友。

To use a big word or a foreign word when a small one and a familiar one will answer the same purpose, is a sign of ignorance. Great scholars and writers and polite speakers use simple words.

当一个简单和熟悉的词语可以表达相同的含义时，（故意）使用大词或舶来词是无知的表现。伟大的学者、作家和演讲家都用简洁的词汇。

The beginning and end are the important places for catching the attention of the reader. Words in these places have greater emphasis than elsewhere.

开头和结尾是最能够抓住读者注意的位置。相比其它地方，这两个地方的词语更强调本身的意思。

Of the two places the end one is the more important, therefore, it really calls for the most important word in the sentence.

（在开头和结尾）中，结尾更为重要，因此句子中最重要的词语应在结尾。

Place the adverb as near as possible to the word it modifies.

尽可能使副词靠近它修饰的词。

The paragraph may be defined as a group of sentences that are closely related in thought and which serve one common purpose.

段落被定义为一组关系密切的句子，为同一个目的而服务。

The object of the first sentence is to state a point clearly; the last sentence should enforce it.

第一句话的目的是清楚地提出一个观点；最后一句话应该强调它。

Affectation and pedantry in style are now universally condemned.

矫揉造作和卖弄学问都是不欢迎的。

Be as original as possible in the use of expression. Don't follow in the old rut but try and strike out for yourself.

语言的表达最好原创。不要跟着旧的车辙，而是尝试自己的风格。

The best rule in regard to only is to place it immediately before the word or phrase it modifies or limits.

Be not the first by whom the new are tried, Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.

To follow the best authors and these masters of language will guide you safely along the way.

Each other refers to two, one another to more than two.
