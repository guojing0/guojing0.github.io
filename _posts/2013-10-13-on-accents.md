title: On Accents

Between English accent (Received Pronunciation or Cockney) and American accent, I prefer former accent. Not because I'm affected by Penny and Alex in The Big Bang Theory, which is known as TBBT, and in which Alex says to Leonard, "Ooh, I love English accents".

Despite my watching a lot of American sitcoms, such as *Friends* and *The Big Bang Theory*, I can not help but fall in love with English accents. It sounds elegant and appealing, formal but slow. Once I sent my record of reciting a fragment of Steve Job's Speech in Stanford to a friend of mine, who was surprised telling me that my voice was quite proper. As yet I can remember that I was trying to address in an English accent, eventually I obtained an good feedback.

So does it mean that I can just learn the surfaces of English accents? Certainly no. Due to the variety of English accents, I would like to imitate different accents and then "refine" what I want to choose. After all no accent is perfect, just as human.
