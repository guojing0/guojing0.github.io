>Here are the four most powerful areas you should focus on that will help you take control of your sleep.

**1.Set Up A Sleep Schedule**

制订一份睡眠时间表

Consistency, consistency, consistency.

+ **Go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time.**

+ This is **arguably more important than how long you sleep.**

+ When you stick to a sleep schedule you will feel amazing throughout the day as your circadian rhythm will be set and you'll be able to keep it consistent.

+ Use a **40 minute sleep window**. For example, I go to sleep anytime between 11:20-12:00 every night and wake up at 7. This ensures I'm hitting 7+hours a night.

**2.Quiet, Dark and Cool**

保持安静，黑暗，凉爽

Sleeping in the right atmosphere is crucial to getting a good night's sleep.

+ **Keep it quiet.** Your brain doesn't turn off when you go to sleep. We are still sensitive to noise when we sleep and any sounds can awaken us (even if you don't remember it in the morning) throwing off our sleep cycles.

+ **Possibly the best thing I've done for my sleep is wear earbuds.**

+ **Keeping your room cool and drinking cold water** right before bed is a great way to stimulate more deep sleep.

+ **Sleep in the dark.** Get dark shades or a tempurpedic iMask. You don't want to be woken up by the sun. **You want your body to sleep for as long as it needs to in a dark and quiet environment.**

+ Sleeping with socks also helps keep your extremities warm which can increase your deep sleep.

**3.Relaxation**

放松

It's crucial to learn to relax right before bed. We are constantly in two different states:

**Parasympathetic**: The state of rest and digest. While in this state your blood pressure and heart rate go down. 

**Learn to relax.** Create a before bed routine, dim the lights and read a book get your body used to "relaxing". 

**4.Track It.**

跟踪睡眠时间

Just like putting on muscle, losing weight, becoming faster or stronger, **you need to track your progress.**
