title: I Pragmatist
---

  In a way, I define myself as a pragmatist - Always think and do what really matters. Hence it becomes the reason why I hate examinations, From my standpoint they stand for "nihil" instead of "full".

  Sometimes I wonder is it nice to ignore something impractical and to be a pragmatist. But a impractical may helps a lot. For instance, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, a book based on *Scheme*, introduces procedures and step by step, teachs how to write a interpreter and a compiler.

  The book isn't practical, but it made many better programmers.

  Thus I should consider a better way.

  BTW I've been going after a better score in TOEFL.
