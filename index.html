I am **Jing Guo**, currently a senior majoring in Mathematics with minor in Computer Science (though I was a Computer Science major once). Prior to studying in Utah, I studied mathematics in *Budapest Semesters in Mathematics* in Hungary and *Math in Moscow* in Russia. Here is an [article](http://www.math.utah.edu/about/news/Studying-Abroad-Dylan-Johnson-and-Jing-Guo.php) on my experience in both programs on the website of math department of University of Utah.

I have been writing blogs since 2009.
