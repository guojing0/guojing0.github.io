在阮一峰的博客看到推荐这首歌的博文，十分喜欢，于是链接在此。

歌词:

Lying here with you so close to me 

It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe

I'm caught up in this moment

caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone

So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms

We don't need to rush this, let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight

Just a touch of the fire burning so bright And I don't want to mess this thing up

I don't want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life 

So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time

It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find

It's never felt so real, it's never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight

Just a touch of the fire burning so bright

I don't want to mess this thing up I don't want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life

So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

I don't want to say goodnight 

I know it's time to leave But you'll be in my dreams Tonight, tonight, tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight

Just a touch of the fire burning so bright

And I don't want to mess this thing up

I don't want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life

So baby, I'm alright

Oh, let's do this right with just a kiss goodnight

With a kiss goodnight, kiss goodnight
