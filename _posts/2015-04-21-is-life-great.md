我前两天在网上看到一篇关于 Keanu Reeves 的[文章](http://dzoantheexplorer.tumblr.com/post/25289594782/this-guy-reading-the-newspaper-on-the-subway-is)，全文如下——

> "This guy reading the newspaper on the subway is Keanu Reeves.

> He is from a problematic family. His father was arrested when he was 12 for drug dealing and his mother was a stripper. His family moved to Canada and there he had several step dads.

> He watched his girlfriend die. They were about to get married, and she died in a car accident. And also before that she had lost her baby. Since then Keanu avoids serious relationships and having kids.

> He's one of the only Hollywood stars without a Mansion. He said: 'I live in a flat, I have everything that I need at anytime, why choose an empty house?'

> One of his best friends died by overdose, he was River Phoenix (Joaquin Phoenix's brother). Almost in the same year Keanu’s father was arrested again. 

> His younger sister had leukemia. Today she is cured, and he donated 70% of his gains from the movie Matrix to Hospitals that treat leukemia.

> In one of his birthdays, he got to a little candy shop and bought him a cake, and started eating alone. If a fan walked by he would talk to them and offer some of the cake.

> He doesn't have bodyguards, and he doesn't wear fancy clothes.

> When they asked him about 'Sad Keanu', he replied: '**You need to be happy to live, I don't.**'"

"YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY TO LIVE. I DON'T."

深以为然。不止是因为我近来处于这个状态，至于是否是其它原因我也不知道。

无病呻吟？我不知道。
