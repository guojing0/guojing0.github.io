    前几天在Hacker News上有一个来源于Wikipedia的链接，我打开并没细读，只是用Chrome大致翻译下就过了。第二天在Weibo上又看到有人链接，并且前面在阮一峰英文博客里有看到有所提及..于是我打算翻译这篇poem，实为拙劣。
    Desiderata是拉丁语，英语涵义则是Desired things。


    平静地在喧嚣和匆忙中行走，铭记沉默中有着安宁，尽可能不要像他人一样屈服于良好的条件。静静地说清你的真相；聆听他人，即便无知与迟钝，他们也同样拥有自己的故事。

    Go placidly amidst the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. 

    避开高亢和借故生端的人们，他们的精神无理取闹。倘若你将自己与他人对比，或许你会痛苦，亦或是自负。永远有人比你更为伟大或渺小。

    Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. 

    享受着你的计划与成就。对你自己的事业保持兴趣——不论多么微小。这在不断变化的命运中才是真正的财富。

    Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. 

    在生意中要格外谨慎，世界充满权谋。但不要让这蒙蔽你的双眼从而忘记发现美德的存在。人们为了理想而奋斗，英雄主义在生活中无处不在。

    Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.
			     

    成为你自己。特别是不要伪装自己的情感。也不要对于爱情愤世嫉俗。面对荒芜与清醒，青草是四季永存的。

    Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. 

    善待这些年的忠告，优雅地向新生事物屈服。培养你的精神以便在突然的厄运中能够庇护着你。但勿因阴暗的想象使你忧伤。恐惧往往生于疲劳与孤寂。

    Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. 

    在健康的纪律之外的，是绅士地对待自我。你是宇宙的孩子，不比树木和星星少，你有着存在的权利。不论它对于你是否清晰，无疑宇宙像它所显露地一般，故和上帝一样平和，无论你希望他成为什么，无论你的劳作与渴望，在这嘈杂混乱的生活中你应与你的灵魂一样保持平静。与它所有的虚伪，乏味，以及破碎的梦想，它依然是一个美好的世界，成为一个快乐的人吧。

    Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
    And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its shams, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. 

    为幸福奋斗！

    Strive to be happy. 

        By Max Ehrmann, Desiderata (Latin: desired things)
