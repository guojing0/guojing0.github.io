I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate in Mathematics with minor in Computer Science at University of Utah. I will be a Ph.D. student in Mathematics starting from Fall, 2020. I am interested in combinatorics, graph theory, and their applications to theoretical computer science.

I have been writing blogs since 2009, though I am not as productive as I was before. I have run the [Chicago Marathon in 2017](//images/chicago-marathon.png) and two half-marathons in [Shanghai in 2014](images/half-marathon.jpg) and in [Hong Kong in 2016](images/hk-hf-marathon.pdf). I also co-led the Chinese translation program for [Gamification](images/translation.pdf) course on Coursera.
