With the development of transportations, people are able to go to everywhere as they want. Planes and trains are faster than any time before. Thus nowadays  more people prefer to traveling to relax and enjoy themselves. But all people face a choice - to traveling alone or with someone else? 

I'd like to be with a companion. Traveling is unpredictable, especially when you travel aboard, you may can not solve many problems just by yourself, some factors always limit you, e.g. different languages, local culture you aren't familiar with and some customs. Being with someone else can make these problems easier, you needn't to face these problems alone, communicating and asking your companion works well sometimes.

Not just the help can they offer, but encourage and inspire you. Imagine a picture in your mind, you are traveling in a rain forest, animals appear and roar, you are lonely and desperate due to lack of food and energy. However, the situation changes if you are with your friends. You will never fear that some wild beasts may attack you or feel helpless with no one to talk with. Your companion is always there for you.

What if you are traveling alone? You probably can solve problems you face all alone and be amazed by you courage. But as you know friends are important, not only in your life, but when you travel as well. Let's suppose you are alone, you would do something crazy or be our of control, no one wants these things happen to you.

That's why I firmly support the point that we should travel with a companion or more. Being with your friends always make you happy and enjoyable. So there is no reasons that you should refuse to travel with you friends!
