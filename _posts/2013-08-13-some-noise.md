Recently no new blog has been posted on my own website, not for the sake of being lazy or nothing fresh happened in my live. But sometimes I really feel lazy not thinking deeply or writing blogs, in retrospect, I often get more input than output. And frankly I'd like to keep my words and/or sentences pithy as neat as I can.

But I can't figure out what to write then, I may just talk about the day, Qixi Festival, also known as Chinese Valentine's Day. Influenced by *Friends* and *Longmen Express*, I do have different views about the social life, relationships between me and my girl, and dealing with different things. The reason I just mention the two series is not only they made me think wider and deeper, but taught me a lot I took for granted before.

For instance, After watching *Friends*, I semi-totally changed my mind on love, sex, relationship, friendship, etc., etc., etc. Let me show some perspective here, Ross & Rachel's relationship in the series is one of my favorite parts of *Friends* - they went out, broke up, went up, broke up and over again - at very last, they had a baby together. I don't want to have a baby, at least now I don't, but I may still enjoy sharing a relationship with someone else. The most moving scenario in *Friends* I ever watched is that Ross asked Rachel not to go but she still got on, then Rachel got off the plane, of course, they hugged and kissed. From old to now, everyone adored love, As Shakespeare composed in *The Tempest*, "Hear my soul speak. Of the very instant that I saw you, Did my heartily at your service" and in *Romeo & Juliet*, "Lovers can do their amorous rites by their own beatuies", etc. I'm not a native English, or I may knew much more than I do here.

*Longmen Express* as a Chinese series does make a great hit these days, the end of the series is approaching, for which I feel a bit frustrated. But as always, I appreciate the couple being together in the series. Looking forward to the next series of *Longmen Express* - If it does exist.

As for me I do not like to talk in details, I'd like to keep my privacy. I aspire to a longtime and healthy relationship but also obtain a higher education I deserve. Afterwards in order to obtain higher SAT and TOEFL grades, I would spend more time on writing essays, reading, watching some talk shows without subtitles. BTW, there are books still should be done in the future.

Now what am I doing? Just repeating theme song of *Longmen Express*. Since the third time I found it really pretty and impressive.

I don't know what I should write down here then, indeed.
