Education systems develop as time flies - Students learned knowledge by going to a special school which only opened for people who wanted to learn. As time went by, more people had chances to obtain advanced and higher education. By now, everyone connecting the Internet is able to learn through MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), which is a great progress in education. And it makes it easier for people to learn by themselves.

Obviously people at past might not get further education after finishing learning at school. But the situation is quite different now. Not only can we gain knowledge by reading, but on the Internet.

Personally speaking, I signed up some nice courses on Coursera, which is an educational technology company offering online courses. I have learned so much on the platform, thus I need not to go to universities personally but on the Internet. I can learn how much and how long as I want, I also can play it back when not understanding what the instructor expresses. Either can you do in a traditional class. That is the reason why online courses make learning easier.

Apparently, learning with teachers is still going well. However, nowadays self-learning is more important than any time in the history. You may do well at school and then get good grades, but it's not the destination of education, it should be that people are able to learn just by themselves and they can do whenever they want. Hence I always prefer learning by myself to being taught by teachers.
