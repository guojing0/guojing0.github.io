As I've watched in *Toy Story*, Sheriff Woody kissed Bo Peep under mistletoes. It was produced by **Pixar Animation Studios** and released by **Walt Disney Pictures**. What really amazed me was that even in *Toy Story*, people - or should I say toys? - they still didn't forget to kiss ultimately.

Another thing I'd like to talk about is that I start use IRC, aka Internet Relay Chat and Usenet today. As a matter of fact, I have ever read some posts on Usenet but not published. For IRC, it's a fancy tool for geeks and/or nerds to chat about some specific issues, I just installed *Bugzilla* in my Firefox and subscribed to some mailing lists.

Keep it pithy, hence above all are what I was going to express.
