Recently no new blogs posted on my own website, not for the sake of being lazy or nothing fresh happened in my live. But sometimes I really feel lazy not thinking deeply or writing blogs, in retrospect, I get more input than output by now. Hence I am writing it now. And frankly I'd like to keep my words and/or sentences pithy as neat as I can.

But now I can't figure out what to write then, I may just talk about the day, Qixi Festival, also known as Chinese Valentine's Day. Influenced by *Friends* and *Longmen Express*, I do have a differs view about the society, relationships between me and my girl, and how to deal with different things. The reason I just mention the two series is not only they made me consider, but taught me a lot.

For instance, Finishing watching *Friends*, I semi-totally change my mind on love, sex, relationship, friendship, etc., etc., etc. Let me show some perspective here, Ross & Rachel's relationship in the series is one of my favorite parts of *Friends* - they went out, broke up, went up, broke up and over again - at very last, they had a baby. I don't want to have a baby, at least now I don't, but I may still enjoy sharing a relationship with someone else. The most moving scenario in *Friends* I ever watched is that Ross told Rachel not to go and then Rachel got off the plane, of course, they hugged and kissed. From old to now, everyone adored love, As Shakespeare composed in *The Tempest* ,"Hear my soul speak. Of the very instant that I saw you, Did my heartily at your service" and in *Romeo & Juliet*, "Lovers can do their amorous rites by their own beatuies", etc. I'm not a native in UK, or I may knew much more than I do here.

*Longmen Express* as a Chinese series does make a great hit these days, but the end of the series is approaching, for which I feel a bit frustrated. But as always, I appreciate the couple being together in the series. Looking forward to the next series of *Longmen Express* - If it does exist.

As for me I do not like to talk in details, I'd like to keep my privacy. I aspire to a longtime and healthy relationship but also obtain a higher education I deserve. Afterwards in order to get higher SAT and TOEFL grades, I would spend more time on writing essays, reading, watching some talk shows without subtitles. BTW, more books should be done.

Now what am I doing? Just repeating theme song of *Longmen Express*. Since the third time I found it really pretty and impressive.

I don't know what I should write down here then, indeed.
