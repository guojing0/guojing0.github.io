---

I am **Jing Guo**. I am a music lover, developer and fan of long-distance running, occasionally. I am happy to be an adult.

I love writing blogs/essays and coding, and I am also fascinated by history, psychology, human behavior, technology and MOOC. You can meet me on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/361951d01125a4915d2bc9815ad17a1b) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/guojing/).

In spare time, I often read books, write posts and try new things. Traveling, photography are another two hobbies.

I have been a blogger since 2009.
