When I travel to other cities, I always prefer museums to entertainment places. The reason why I love visiting museums is that they contain local cultures, paintings and traditional exhibitions.

I travelled in London, I was eager to visit the British Museum, Nation Gallery and some other museums. Not only could I learn different cultures and histories, but the mind behind them. After visiting different exhibitions, they amazed and "taught" me so much. The knowledge learnt from museums can never be learnt from entertainment places, such as bars, theme parks, etc.

At least as I see, the beauty of museums lies in the connotation and the mind. Compared to entertainment places, museums are more "serious" for visitors. Learning the inside knowledge is quite hard if you are not able to keep calm and explore the mind behind them.

Further more, people can obtain various knowledge from different museums. As for visiting a art museum, paintings always imply background of a specific period. For instance, Guernica painted by Pablo Picasso appealed people to fight against Nazi. If you were visiting a natural museum, you were supposed to see the history of the Earth and the evolution of plants and animals. Thus we can tell the museum is a place for learning knowledge rather than for fun.

Learning is always with us as we grow up, in a way visiting museums is a better choice than entertainment. After all, we still have time for playing around.
