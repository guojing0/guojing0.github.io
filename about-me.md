I am **Jing Guo**. I am a music lover, developer and fan of long-distance running, occasionally.

I love writing blogs/essays and coding, am also fascinated by history, psychology, Human behavior, technology and MOOC. You can meet me on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/361951d01125a4915d2bc9815ad17a1b">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/guojing/">Khan Academy</a>.

In spare time, I often read books, write posts and try new things. Traveling, photography are two hobbies I have.

I have been a blogger since 2009.
