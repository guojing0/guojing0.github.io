My research interests are extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, graph theory, and theoretical computer science. I graduated from University of Utah in Spring, 2020. 

I have been writing blogs since 2009, though I am not as productive as I was before. I have run the [Chicago Marathon in 2017](images/chicago-marathon.png) and two half-marathons in [Shanghai in 2014](/images/half-marathon.jpg) and in [Hong Kong in 2016](/images/hk-hf-marathon.pdf). I also co-led the Chinese translation program for [Gamification](/images/translation.pdf) course on Coursera.
