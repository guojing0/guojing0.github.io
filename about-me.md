**Guo Jing** is the one posting this blog, id est sum. I was born in 1995.

What you are seeing is the site created by me. Also coding is one of my hobbies. And I've been a blogger since 2009. BTW, I want to be a *Jedi*, but I have to say now I'm enjoying *Star Trek* more.

When in spare time, I often read books, write blogs and codes. Traveling, taking photos are two other things I'd like to do.

I've been studying Virology, Probability and Writing on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/361951d01125a4915d2bc9815ad17a1b">Coursera</a>, and also on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/guojing/">Khan Academy</a>.
