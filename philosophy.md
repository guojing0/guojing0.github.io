title: Philosophy of Design
---

Minimalism, the term demands a designed subject should be reduced to its necessary elements - no more, no less. I love the idea of design, therefore, the design of my blog can be considered as a practice of minimalism.

The very original idea was based on minimalistic design, but not the key reason. Unnecessary pictures and elements usually slow down the loading speed and it bothered me when I visited webpages on my cell phone, that is why I keep it simple.

Make yourself comfortable and enjoy it.
