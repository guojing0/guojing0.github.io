> In some counties, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think it is a good idea?

> Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.

After Industrial Revolution in England, as the development of industry, most children were hired as child labors. Some years later, a statement issued by the government that forbidden underage people to work in factories.

However, in some developing countries, children still worked as child labors. But more students tend to help others and serve for their own communities as volunteers. As far as I consider, it's a good phenomenon in the modern society - Students learn to help others without asking for something.

Further more, I also support that it's good that students have jobs while they learning at school. Working with coworkers makes you a better person, you'll know how to efficiently communicate and cooperate with others. Also you can learn from your employers knowing how to work better. What's else, you can take risks but no need to worry about losing your "job" at school, thus you have the chance to develop your own ability to express and implement ideas in your mind.

If I were in Silicon Valley, the high-tech area in California. I'd like to be hired by tech companies, for instance, Google, Twitter etc. I will learn to apply knowledge I have into real-life practice. I think learning while working is quite good and will be more interesting than just study at school.

In summary, therefore I believe teens have jobs while they are studying at school is a quite nice idea, You won't feel learning is boring but practical. So I do support those who still learn at school but have a job.
