title: What I Learned in Hong Kong
---

Coming back from Hong Kong a few days ago, I realized something can not be seen in mainland China but in Hong Kong. Hong Kong as a colony of Britain until 1997 already inherited something good from Britain, therefore I was not surprised to learn what I observed there was quite different from my life in here.

Hong Kong is a peaceful city, even in the central of the city. No one yells and shouts, I can barely distinguish it from London where I have been. People in Hong Kong usually behave politely, no matter to whom they speak or help. It once was British colony and domination of Britain lasted for 155 years. I can see that natives were influenced by British customs and etiquette that are still important in today Western society. In the respect the British ruler did do a good thing, or Hong Kong would not be Hong Kong.

I found people would not cross roads until traffic lights turn into green. I admit it normal and natural, however, as I notice in my city, people seldom wait for the light turning into green but go with others. The phenomenon can be easily explained as bandwagon effect in psychology. The effect states that individuals make decisions based on relative information they receive or what others choose. Because we are human and it is the common ground everyone shares - regardless of the nationality, race or gender. Even so we ought to control over our own brains to behave gently.

Forgive my cynicism, I can see generations of people around me acting rudely still reckon themselves behave well. I'm not saying everyone does as what I see but most do - even they are not barbarians.
