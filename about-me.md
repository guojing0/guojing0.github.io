I am **Jing Guo**, currently in *Budapest Semesters in Mathematics* in Hungary. I will be back at University of Utah in Fall, 2019, majoring in Mathematics with minor in computer science (though I was once a computer science major). Prior to studying in Budapest, I studied mathematics in *Math in Moscow* in Russia.

In my spare time, I enjoy classical music, reading, programming, running, and thinking.

I have been writing blogs since 2009.

Note: Yes, I want to do a Ph.D. in Mathematics, so my CV is [here](Jing_Guo-CV.pdf) and on the right.
